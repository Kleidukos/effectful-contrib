# effectful-contrib 

This repository used to host bindings for the [`effectful`][effectful] library by Andrzej Rybczak.  
They have now moved to their own repositories:

* [effectful-cache](https://github.com/haskell-effectful/effectful-cache): A `Cache` effect to use the
  [cache library][cache].
* [effectful-log-base](https://github.com/haskell-effectful/effectful-log-base): A `Logging` effect based on the
  [log-base library][log-base].
* [effectful-log-elasticsearch](https://github.com/haskell-effectful/effectful-log-elasticsearch): An ElasticSearch
  backend for [effectful-log-base](https://github.com/haskell-effectful/effectful-log-base) based on the
  [log-elasticsearch library][log-elasticsearch].
* [effectful-time](https://github.com/haskell-effectful/effectful-time): A `Time` effect to use the
  [time library][time].
* [effectful-typed-process](https://github.com/haskell-effectful/effectful-typed-process): A `Process` effect based
  on the [typed-process library][typed-process].
